    <h1>The life of Shea Parrott</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I was born and raised in Jacksonville florida. I have 2 other brothers. I am the oldest and shortest, I blame the <em>coffee</em> for that last part. I started drinking coffee at age 7. Up until the age 10, I moved every year and went to a new school each year. I graduated in 2010 from First Coast High. Then, I went to one semester of college. However, the school I choose was an overpriced University. I could only afford one semester, and had to quit. </p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>gaming</li>
        <li>skateboarding</li>
        <li>hitting up the local brewary</li>
        <li>listening/exploring new music</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Today</h2>
      <p> I am a student at <em>Suncoast Developers Guild</em>, this is my first day. I have been here in St. Pete for 6 days now. I am excited to start this new chapter in my life. I am told this is the hardest thing many people have taken on. I am curious to see if I will be saying the same in the coming weeks or months. Ultimately, I feel blessed to be here and I cant wait to see where this journey will take me. </p>
